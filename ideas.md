extremely incohesive feverdream

## Ideas
- Puzzle game where you transition into a dream world that mirror the regular one, but a bit weird. Maybe lean on incohesive, things don't stick together in the dream? Things heat up because of fever?

- Inject yourself with disease to "dissociate".
    - Vampire survivors-like, or possibly manual shooting
    - Vaccine or medicine that stops your powers, but allows you to move unhindered?
    - What are the enemies?
