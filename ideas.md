extremely incohesive feverdream

## Ideas
- Puzzle game where you transition into a dream world that mirror the regular one, but a bit weird. Maybe lean on incohesive, things don't stick together in the dream? Things heat up because of fever?

- Inject yourself with disease to "dissociate".
    - Vampire survivors-like, or possibly manual shooting
    - Vaccine or medicine that stops your powers, but allows you to move unhindered?
    - What are the enemies?

## Vampire survivors-like
- Takes place in the dream of a fevering person (perhaps in their brain more literally?)
- Viruses as enemies, shoot antibodies and immune cells at them
- Make sprite sheets out of platonic solids for enemies, animate spinning loop
- Intro of zooming into brain of sleeping person
- Waves of enemies
- Multiple weapons
- Upgrades
- Bosses
- Highscore
- Temperature/fever mechanic
    - Hot makes viruses take more damage but move faster
    - Cold makes slower
